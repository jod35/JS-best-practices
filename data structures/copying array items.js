//here we use the slice() method
/*the slice method extracts from an Array
it takes two args
1.the index from which to start extracting
2.the index from which to stop

// forexample, 

let myArray=['Jonathan',"Jolly","Jannet","Jackson","Jodes"];

console.log(myArray.slice(1,3)); //[ 'Jolly', 'Jannet' ]
