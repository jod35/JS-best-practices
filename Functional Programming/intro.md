# Functional Programming In Javascript

Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope.

` INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT `

## Some Terminologies
* Callbacks: these are functions that are passed into other functions to decide the invocation of other functions.

* First Class Functions: these are functions that can be assigned to variables, passed into
functions and can also be returned from other functions. All JS functions are first class 
functions

* Higher Order Functions: these are functions that can take other functions as arguments or 
can return functions as return values

When the functions are passed in to another function or returned from another function, then those functions which gets passed in or returned can be called a lambda.
